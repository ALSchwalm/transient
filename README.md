[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/transient/badge/?version=latest)](https://transient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

`transient` is a utility for runing QEMU with existing disk images and shared folders.
Currently `transient` only supports [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) images.

Installation
-----
Install `transient` via `pip`:

```
pip install transient
```

Usage
-----

`transient` is primarily a wrapper for QEMU. It supplies a small set of flags that
are used to add additional features to the VM being started. As the name implies,
it is almost completely stateless. This avoids problems that can sometimes occur
with `libvirt` based tools becoming 'unsynchronized' with the real system state.

For example, in the following command, the flags before the `--` are passed to
`transient`. The remaining arguments are passed directly to QEMU. This example
will cause `transient` to download and run a Centos7 VM (from the Vagrant Cloud)
with 1GB of memory using a text console. The `name` parameter is used to allow
subseqent invocations to use the same disk image, so changes will persist.

```
python -m transient \
   -name test-vm \
   -image centos/7:2004.01 \
   -- \
   -nographic -enable-kvm -m 1G
```

`transient` also supports a `vagrant` style SSH connection. This will start the
virtual machine and connect standard input and output to an SSH connection
with the machine, instead of the serial console. However, when this connection
is closed, the machine will be terminated (unlike `vagrant`). For example:

```
python -m transient \
   -name test-vm \
   -ssh-console \
   -image centos/7:2004.01 \
   -- \
   -enable-kvm -m 1G
```

The `-ssh-console` flag depends on the image having the normal vagrant keypair
trusted for the `vagrant` user.
