Feature: VM Persistence
  In order to support test/dev senarios where disk persistence is
  needed, transient can boot using the same disk multiple times.

 Scenario: Reboot a VM keeping changes
    Given a transient vm
      And a name "test-vm"
      And a frontend "./test-frontend"
      And a disk image "generic/alpine38:v3.0.2"
      And a ssh command "touch persist-is-working"
     When the vm runs to completion
      And a new ssh command "ls"
      And the vm runs to completion
     Then the return code is 0
      And stdout contains "persist-is-working"
