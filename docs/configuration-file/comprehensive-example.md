### Comprehensive Example

```
# A Transient config file

#
# Transient arguments are set in a similar manner compared to the command line.
# A few differences exist:
#
#   1. All values are set using an equal sign:
#
#          shutdown-timeout = 20
#
#
#   2. Strings are encapsulated with double quotes
#
#          name = "vm_name"
#
#
#   3. Flags are set to Booleans:
#
#          prepare-only = true
#          ssh-console = false
#
#
#   4. Lists are encapsulated by square brackets:
#
#          shared-folder = [
#              "/path/on/host:/path/on/guest",
#              "/path/on/host2:/path/on/guest2"
#          ]
#

#
# QEMU arguments are set in a similar manner compared to the command line.
#
# The only difference is that the QEMU argument string is split by whitespace
# and encapsulated in a list.
